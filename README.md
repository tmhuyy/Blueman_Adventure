- **Game name**: Blueman Adventure
- **Motivation**: <br>
We had to stay indoors and do nothing for a long time due to social distancing, therefore we decided to build a game where people could go out and explore. Other interesting surprises await behind the door. <br>
Moreover, in that spare time, we rediscovered the games of our childhood and with what we learned through this subject (OOP), it coincidentally met enough for us to create a game with 2D graphics. With a combination of inspiration from many legend titles such as Legend of Zelda, Super Mario on Nintendo's Game Boy in the 1900s.<br>
